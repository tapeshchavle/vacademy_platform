## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/vacademy_platform.git
   cd vacademy_platform
   ```
3. **Create a branch** from `main` for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Make your changes, write tests where applicable, and commit using [conventional commits](#commit-message-conventions).
5. **Push** your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the upstream repository.

## Development Setup

Vacademy is a monorepo containing several services. Here is how to get each part running locally.

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+ (for the AI service)

### Backend (Spring Boot microservices)

The backend services are orchestrated with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts the database, message broker, and all backend microservices. To run a specific service locally for development, refer to its `README` or run:

```bash
cd <service-directory>
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Frontend

There are two frontend applications, both built with React + TypeScript + Vite.

**Admin Dashboard:**

```bash
cd frontend-admin-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Learner Dashboard:**

```bash
cd frontend-learner-dashboard-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### AI Service (Python)

```bash
cd ai-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Java (backend):** Follow standard Java conventions. Use meaningful variable and method names. Keep methods short and focused. Format code consistently (IDE defaults for IntelliJ or VS Code with Java extensions are fine).
- **TypeScript/React (frontend):** Use functional components and hooks. Prefer named exports. Use TypeScript types over `any`. Keep components small and composable.
- **Python (AI service):** Follow PEP 8. Use type hints where possible.
- **General:** Remove unused imports, avoid commented-out code in PRs, and write descriptive variable names.

## Commit Message Conventions

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Each commit message should have the format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

| Type       | Usage                                      |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | A new feature                              |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                  |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                      |
| `style`    | Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.       |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes nor adds    |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                   |
| `chore`    | Build process, dependency updates, etc.    |

**Examples:**

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login for learners
fix(catalog): correct pagination on course listing
docs: update CONTRIBUTING with setup instructions
```

## Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Please open a GitHub Issue and include:

1. **Summary** — a clear, concise description of the problem.
2. **Steps to reproduce** — numbered steps to trigger the bug.
3. **Expected behavior** — what you expected to happen.
4. **Actual behavior** — what actually happened.
5. **Environment** — OS, browser, Java version, Node version, or any other relevant details.
6. **Screenshots or logs** — if applicable.

Please search existing issues first to avoid duplicates.

## Requesting Features

Have an idea? Open a GitHub Issue with the label `enhancement` and include:

1. **Problem statement** — what problem does this solve?
2. **Proposed solution** — how you envision it working.
3. **Alternatives considered** — any other approaches you thought about.
4. **Additional context** — mockups, examples, or references.

We appreciate well-thought-out proposals, but even rough ideas are welcome.

## Pull Request Review Process

1. Once you open a PR, a maintainer will be assigned to review it, typically within a few business days.
2. Ensure your PR:
   - Has a clear title and description explaining **what** and **why**.
   - Passes all CI checks (build, tests, linting).
   - Is scoped to a single concern — avoid mixing unrelated changes.
   - Includes tests for new functionality or bug fixes where applicable.
3. Reviewers may request changes. Please address feedback promptly or discuss if you disagree.
4. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

**Tip:** Smaller PRs get reviewed faster. If your change is large, consider breaking it into smaller, incremental PRs.
