/**
 * Response DTO for the POST /meeting/recordings/sync endpoint.
 *
 * status values:
 *   OK          — all BBB recordings found were synced (or already up to date)
 *   BBB_OFFLINE — BBB server was unreachable; returned current DB state unchanged
 *   PARTIAL     — some recordings synced, others failed (download/upload errors)
 *   RECOVERING  — BBB API returned no recordings, but raw files exist on the BBB
 *                 server with a stalled pipeline. The heal service has been asked
 *                 to restart the rap-worker pipeline. Recording will appear after
 *                 BBB finishes processing (~10 minutes).
 *   NOT_FOUND   — BBB has no recording for this meeting and no raw files exist on
 *                 the server — nothing to recover.
